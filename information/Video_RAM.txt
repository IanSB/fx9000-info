Video RAM
=========

15-March-2023

One of the RAM chips in the FX-9000P is in some form of socket. All of
the machines I have seen have this single socketed device. I thought
originally that it was a special socket that re-wired an error on the PCB,
but I have now removed the socket and found that it is just an ordinary
IC socket. ther eis no re-wiring of any signals. I have replaced that socket
in my machine with a socket that matches the other RAM sockets I added.
All of my video RAM is now socketed and it all work fine. Two of the RAM
chips had failed and are now replaced by RP2040 video RAM replacement
PCBs.
